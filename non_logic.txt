1. Do you prefer vuejs or reactjs? Why ?
    - The documentaries are both very detailed but I prefer the reactjs because I think it's easier to study.

2. What complex things have you done in frontend development ?
    - So far there's no big complex thing I've been working on. 
    But I had considerable experience in this area and I could adapt to a new language or I could easily learn new things.

3. why does a UI Developer need to know and understand UX? how far do you understand it?
    - UX is indispensable, since a good website depends not only on attracting its views and meeting
    views but on websites that match the goals it has created and its usage that are not discomposing. 
    If UI developer doesn't understand ux, he will only prioritize neatness and harmony of the website and tend to override its intended functions. 
    So it would create multiple revisions if it was in the making and create confusion when it was used by the user. 
    Of course we don't want to do the frontend because we also have to re-examine the pages that we're going to change into a website.
    At the core UI developers must know how to make websites that are easy to use user and user easy to understand websites 
    being used only from seeing them.

4. Give your analysis results regarding https://taskdev.mile.app/login from the UI / UX side!
    - I think the login page is pretty good. But the login card can take a lot of places, 
    so you can't scroll it but for a login, I don't think that's accurate. 
    From the side of the back button there I also find it inappropriate, 
    since it slightly impairs the view of the login page. It's a good thing the back button was replaced by a logo on the hedaer
    and a link to home, which I think is much better.

5. Create a better login page based on https://taskdev.mile.app/login and deploy on https://www.netlify.com (https://www.netlify.com/)!
